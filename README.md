Image Processing using Python Pillow Library
# Description

Python's Pillow library is used to process an image file. The brightness of the image is varied. All the images with different brightness are grouped together in a canvas or contact sheet.

This is the first project that I uploaded to my GitHub. Hoping to do something much better in the future.
